# Changelog

## Unreleased

- No unreleased changes.

## 2.5.1 — 2026-08-22

- fixed the repository Marketplace entry to pin the installable plugin to the
  immutable `v2.5.1` release instead of resolving the previous `v2.4.0`
  snapshot;
- synchronized plugin, package, contract-package, recipe-catalog, standalone
  Skill and evaluation-corpus distribution metadata at 2.5.1;
- retained the V2.5.0 contract and runtime wire formats, so this installation
  fix requires no artifact migration.

## 2.5.0 — 2026-08-22

- added provider-neutral `CharacterMorphologySpec` and `MorphologyReview`
  contracts for semantic face/body axes, structural relations, hard and soft
  locks, bounded nearby variation, neutral three-view evidence and human-only
  identity approval;
- added one-axis `StyleExplorationBrief`, `StyleOptionSet` and
  `StylePreferenceFeedback` contracts so users can compare representations
  without changing character, appearance, scene, action, camera or physical
  light;
- added exact `RepresentationBinding` between Character and Style, including
  abstraction budgets, scale visibility, allowed transformations and protected
  identity anchors for photoreal, Anime, Manga, illustration, stylized 3D and
  scope-based hybrid representations;
- added Natural Human Rendering as a cross-Skill capability spanning stable
  surface facts, current skin-material state, representational light and
  surface grammar, human capture, visibility-aware prompting and family-specific
  ControlBench checks—without adding a monolithic realism Skill;
- added atomic `face_identity`, `skin_surface`, `skin_material`, `capture` and
  other representation evidence roles for portrait decomposition, with an
  end-to-end role-scoped portrait WorkflowPlan and explicit identity exclusion;
- added six deterministic production recipes for morphology, natural-human,
  one-axis style exploration, Anime, Manga and six-family cross-representation
  validation; each generates independent tasks, retries failed tasks only and
  assembles approved outputs deterministically;
- expanded provider capabilities, evidence roles, family Bench semantics,
  semantic negative tests, activation/composition cases and deterministic live
  replay fixtures while preserving provider-neutral Canon and human gates;
- advanced the local runtime and project schemas additively to V2.5.0 while
  retaining non-destructive support for valid V2.2, V2.3.x and V2.4 artifacts
  and project bundles;
- expanded the release gate to 69 contracts, 66 uniquely owned routes, 14
  built-in recipes, 32 behavior cases, 13 live replay cases and 37 runtime tests
  across all nine standalone/composable Skills.

## 2.4.0 — 2026-08-22

- added the standalone and composable `$cineweave-reference` Skill, bringing the
  suite to nine Skills;
- added content-addressed `ReferenceAsset`, atomic `ReferenceObservation` and
  exact `ReferenceBindingSet` contracts while retaining explicit V2.0
  `ReferenceSet` compatibility;
- moved reference ingestion, verification, role scoping, suitability review and
  binding ownership out of Director;
- added bounded local PNG, JPEG, WebP, MP4/M4V, MOV and WebM ingestion with
  extension/signature matching, image-dimension limits, generated blob names,
  non-executable storage and no retained source path or original filename;
- separated byte integrity, content credentials, copyright, likeness, training,
  publication, provider-transfer and redistribution decisions;
- added spatial, temporal, spatiotemporal and mask selectors, one-role-per-
  observation transfer rules and identity/geography conflict protection;
- added project-bundle format 1.1 with exact reference-blob transfer and
  continued verification/import support for V2.3.1 format 1.0 bundles;
- added reference-ingest and reference-verify CLI commands plus tamper, dedupe,
  malformed-container, rights-gate, graph and bundle tests;
- expanded the release gate to 63 contracts, 61 uniquely owned routes, 28
  behavior cases, 11 deterministic live replay cases and 37 runtime tests
  across all nine Skills.

## 2.3.1 — 2026-08-21

- added strict `ArtifactGraph` and `ProjectBundleManifest` suite contracts;
- added structural exact-ref discovery, dependency/dependent closures, stale-ref
  reporting, same-version hash-mismatch detection and deterministic cycle
  analysis;
- added exact approval-gate queries whose decisions never transfer between
  versions, with optional current-version and dependency-approval policies;
- added graph, stale, gate, export, import and bundle-verification CLI commands;
- added directory-based project transfer with per-file byte hashes, fixed path
  categories, link and traversal rejection, staged verification, atomic install
  and no-overwrite behavior;
- preserved V2.2 and V2.3.0 projects and artifacts without mutation;
- expanded runtime coverage to 29 deterministic tests, including CLI, bundle
  round-trip, tamper, duplicate, unexpected-file and path-escape cases;
- expanded the release gate to 60 contracts and 57 uniquely owned routes.

## 2.3.0 — 2026-08-21

- added provider-neutral `AdapterDescriptor`, exact `ExecutionRequest` and
  runtime-authored `ExecutionReceipt` contracts;
- added a trusted in-process adapter registry with implementation-hash matching,
  immutable idempotency claims and constrained execution outputs;
- required exact-request approval and explicit caller enablement before any
  external adapter effect;
- added complete retry-cost accounting, normalized failures and byte-level
  output verification to project integrity checks;
- shipped a zero-cost, network-free deterministic SVG fixture adapter and CLI
  adapter/execution commands;
- added a strict `SkillEvaluationRun` contract and semantic summary checks;
- added ten synthetic live Skill cases covering all eight Skills plus a
  should-not-activate case, committed deterministic responses and replay grading;
- added an opt-in, explicit-cost live Codex evaluation runner using isolated,
  read-only tasks and strict structured output;
- expanded the release gate to 58 contracts and 57 uniquely owned routes.

## 2.2.0 — 2026-08-21

- split screenwriting and general text-to-image management into the independent
  `$cineweave-story` and `$cineweave-prompt` Skills;
- expanded the suite to eight standalone/composable Skills and 54 uniquely
  owned contracts;
- added StoryBrief, BeatSheet, ScriptScene and ContinuityLedger;
- added PerformanceTimeline, SceneLightState, StyleLightGrammar, ShotSpec,
  ShotLightingPlan, TemporalSpec and PromptRepair;
- separated physical scene light, representational light grammar and shot-level
  source use;
- added zero-prompt character exploration, controlled options and user-led
  preference convergence without automatic beauty scoring or identity lock;
- added a strict local runtime with RFC-8785-compatible hashes, concurrent
  immutable version claims and exact-hash approvals;
- added deterministic external board assembly with per-tile hashes and partial
  failure provenance;
- removed an unverified user-upload image from the distributable plugin and
  added a binary/reference rights audit;
- added 24 behavior cases, expanded semantic negative tests and Windows/Linux CI;
- pinned the marketplace source to the immutable `v2.2.0` release tag.
